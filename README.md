# PuppyRaffle Audit

This repo showcases the work done in the fourth lesson of the Cyfrin Updraft Security & Auditing course. In this lesson I undertook my second audit, learning some of the most common smart contract vulnerabilities and how to properly report them. The results can be seen in `audit-data/2024-05-10-puppyRaffle-audit.pdf`.
